Apply Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) concepts

1. Risks associated with hardware, software, and services

NIST SP800-161 - Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations (page 7)

Supply chain risks include insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production,
tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware (e.g., GPS
	tracking devices, computer chips, etc.), as well as poor manufacturing and
	development practices in the supply chain. These risks are realized when
	threats in the supply chain exploit existing vulnerabilities.

2. Third-party assessment and monitoring

	SLA's vs. Assurance via Due Diligence

3. Minimum security requirements

	Requirements gathering

4. Service-level requirements

	SLA vs SLR


In addition:

Onsite Assessment
Document Exchange and Review
Process/Policy Review
Third Party Audit


Managing known risks

	1. Identify and document risks
	2. Build a supply-chain risk-management framework
	3. Monitor risk
	4. Institute governance and regular review


Supply Chain Risk Management Strategies

1. PPRR risk management model - a popular global supply chain risk management
strategy and is used by retailers around the world. “PPRR” stands for:

	 Prevention - Take precautionary measures for supply chain risk mitigation.
	 Preparedness - Develop and implement a contingency plan in case of an emergency.
	 Response - Execute on your contingency plan in order to reduce the impact
	of the disruptive event.
	 Recovery - Resume operations and get things running at normal capacity as
	quickly as possible.


2. Manage environmental risk in your supply chain - single vs. multi supplier

Supply chain risk assessment software enables you to take a proactive approach
to risk management by providing you with greater visibility into the structure
of your supply chain. With such a solution, you will be able to identify weak
points in your supply chain and receive data-driven insights into how you can
strengthen them.


3. Improve your cyber supply chain risk management:

	 Establish compliance standards for all third-party vendors, including
	manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors.

	 Define user roles and implement security controls to restrict who is able
	to access your system and what level of clearance they are given.

	 Perform a thorough vendor risk assessment prior to signing any contracts.

	 Implement data stewardship standards that define who owns certain data and
	what they are able to do with that data.

	 Provide comprehensive training for all employees about cybersecurity protocols.

	 Implement a software solution that provides you with total visibility into
	your supply chain, so you can quickly identify unusual activity.

	 Work with vendors in your supply chain network to develop a unified disaster
	recovery plan to ensure business continuity.

	 Establish backup controls to safeguard your data backups.

	 Regularly update your company’s anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall
	software solutions, as well as look into more advanced cybersecurity measures,
	such as DNS filtering and network access control.


4. Gain visibility into suppliers’ financial stability

5. Track the right freight carrier metrics:

	 Transit Time - the number of hours or days it takes for a shipment to arrive
	at the customer’s location after leaving your facility.

	 Number of Stops & Average Stop Time - The more stops a freight carrier takes
	in route to delivering a shipment, the longer it will take your product to
	reach your customer. Even if a route only includes a few stops, a long average
	stop time could still jeopardize on-time delivery and disrupt your supply chain.
	These metrics are important to monitor for the sake of supply chain efficiency.

[Note: It’s important to look for a low number of stops and low average stop time
while still being mindful of drivers’ legally regulated hours of service.]

	 Average Loading Time - This refers to the amount of time it takes to load a
	carrier with freight, as well as fill out any necessary paperwork, once it has
	arrived at the loading dock. Like the previous item on this list, this is a
	key indicator of supply chain efficiency.

	 Route Optimization - It’s important that retailers consider how field
	carriers optimize routes for fuel usage and travel time because these have a
	direct effect on supply chain costs and efficiency. If a retailer has its own
	fleet, it can monitor this metric closely; if it partners with a third-party
	carrier, it can monitor this metric through costs charged for shipping.

	 Maintenance Schedule - A freight carrier with a consistent maintenance
	schedule is less likely to break down, which can prevent unnecessary supply chain
	disruption.



6. Implement a logistics contingency plan - Similar to an emergency response
plan, it’s imperative that retailers have a logistics contingency plan in place
to ensure business continuity in the event of supply chain disruption.

Some tips when creating a contingency plan for supply chain risk mitigation:

	 Map out your supply chain to get a clear understanding of which entities
	are most vulnerable to risk.

	 Perform a full assessment of suppliers based on factors such as political
	risk, geographic risk, and economic risk.

	 Diversify your supplier network so that you are not reliant on a single
	supplier.

	 Audit logistics providers based on their disaster plans.

	 Establish a crisis response team to make critical decisions in the event of
	an emergency.

	 Develop solid communications channels so that your employees know what their
	responsibilities are in the event of supply chain disruption.

	 Carefully document all processes and create a single source of truth that
	employees can refer to when executing on your contingency plan.

	 Stay up to date on current events and adapt your contingency plan accordingly.


7. Conduct internal risk awareness training - Management is not the only area
of your organization that can assist in supply chain risk mitigation. In fact,
building a risk-aware culture requires buy-in at all levels of your business. The
easiest way to achieve this is to conduct risk awareness training for your entire
workforce. Training curriculum should include the following:

	 Common supply chain management risks and challenges
	 Risk management best practices
	 Computer and internet best practices to improve cybersecurity awareness
	 Supply chain risk assessment software training to encourage end user adoption


8. Consistently monitor risk

9. Use data to model key risk event scenarios

10. Consolidate your data for easy access
