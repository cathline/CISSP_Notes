## Asset Security Key Points


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand and identify the key points and items from Domain 2 that need to be
mastered as part of your preparation to take and pass the CISSP exam.


### External Resources:

Asset Security - Key points

1. Classification & Categorization


2. How to manage sensitive information


3. Data / Retention policies


4. Data Policy


5. Asset Inventory | Classification | Labeling | Handling

Data classification schemes (2 types - Government & Private Sector)


6. NIST NICE Framework: Securely Provision (SP) NICE Specialty Areas

a. Risk Management (RSK)
b. Software Development (DEV)
c. Systems Architecture (ARC)
d. Technology R&D (TRD)
e. Systems Requirements Planning (SRP)
f. Test & Evaluation (TST)
g. Systems Development (SYS)


7. Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) vs Information Lifecycle Management (ILM)


8. Data Management Lifecycle (PLAN + 5 phases)

0. PLAN FIRST !!

a. Data Creation
b. Storage
c. Usage/Share
d. Archival
e. Destruction


9. QA (external) vs. QC (internal) & Collection Limitation on data


10. Roles to know:

a. data subject - subject of personal data
b. data owner - master of all
c. data controller - determines processing purpose(s)
d. data processor - managers of all (on behalf of the controller)
e. data custodian - custody, transport, storage & business rules
f. data steward - fitness of data elements
g. administrator - grants permissions / access to data



11. Data, data, data - Remanence & Sanitization

a. clearing
b. purging
c. destruction
e. simple delete = erase
f. destruction - types
  Overwriting
  Degaussing
  Encryption
  Crypto-Shredding
  Physical Destruction
  Chemical Alteration
  Phase Shift / transition (Curie Temp)
  SSD vs HDD

*** Cloud data - encrypt data while in storage and use ==> upon exit crypto-shred
remaining data


12. Asset Retention - What are the Stages?

• GA / Sale Date
• End of Life / End of Sale
• End of Development
• End of Service Life / End of Support



13. End-of-Life Management

• Maintaining inventories
• Approved end-of-life or sunset policy
• Tracking changes, availability of updates, and end of support
• Risk assessments to determine end-of-life
• Plan for the replacement of systems and comply with policy requirements
• Procedures for secure destruction or data wiping of hard drives



14. Data states

Data exists in 3 well defined states:

a. at rest (storage)
b. in motion (transit / on the wire)
c. in use (application in memory)


15. Link vs End-to-End encryption


16. Scoping & Tailoring (Supplementation)


17. Standards...


18. Data protection methods (Digital Rights Management (DRM), Data Loss
Prevention (DLP), Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB))

a. at rest (storage) -
  encryption
  obfuscation / tokenization
  archive / dispose / destruct
  mobile device protection
  physical media control

b. in motion (transit) -
  encryption
  perimeter security
  web content filtering
  network traffic monitoring
  VPN's

c. in use (application) -
  encryption
  user monitoring
  workstation restrictions
  application controls (whitelist / blacklist)
  data labeling
