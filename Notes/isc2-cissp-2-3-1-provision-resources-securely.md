## Provision resources securely


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand and apply the recommended guidance to provision resources securely
through your daily practice as an information security professional.


### External Resources:

Provision resources securely

1. Information and asset ownership
2. Asset inventory (e.g., tangible, intangible)
3. Asset management

=============================

The larger a business becomes, the more difficult it gets to manage the data it
generates in a consistent and safe manner. While this might seem like a benign
issue at first, the consequences of poorly managed data can quickly lead to things
like data sprawl, lost files or privacy violations that can severely harm a company.


A data policy defines the goals for data management. A data policy:

1. Establishes a guiding framework for data management.

2. Addresses issues such as data access, relevant legal matters, data stewardship
and custodial duties, data acquisition, and other issues.

The policy and process used to provide access to data based on a legal request
must be designed and implemented so that they do not violate access controls
and / or any existing policies, ensuring that only the data subject to the
request is made available, and not exposing any unrelated data.



Create an information asset inventory

Allows senior leaders to establish what kinds of classified information exist in
the company, and who is responsible for it (or in other words, who is its owner).


Classification of information


	Owner of the data classifies !!!


Information labeling

Information labeling procedures need to cover information in physical and
electronic formats and its related assets.

The labeling needs to represent the defined classification scheme.

The labels are to be clearly identifiable. The protocols will provide instructions
on where and how labels are applied taking into account whether the information
is obtained or the assets are managed based on media forms.

The procedures that identify situations where labeling is absent, e.g.
non-confidential information labeling to scale back workloads. Employees and
contractors should be made aware of the procedures for labeling.

An appropriate classification label should be included in the output from the
system containing information classified as sensitive or critical.



Handling of assets

Develop rules that will actually protect each kind of information asset
contingent on its level of sensitivity.



Types of data classifications: (2 major schemes)


Government/military:

	Top Secret – It is the highest level in this classification scheme. The
  unauthorized disclosure of such information can be expected to cause
  exceptionally grievous damage to the national security.

	Secret – Very restricted information. The unauthorized disclosure of such data
  can be expected to cause significant damage to the national security.

	Confidential – A category that encompasses sensitive, private, proprietary and
  highly valuable data. The unauthorized disclosure of such data can be expected
  to cause serious, noticeable damage to the national security.


NOTE: These three level of data are collectively known as ‘Classified’ data.


	Unclassified – It is the lowest level in this classification scheme. Furthermore,
  this data is neither sensitive nor classified, and hence it is available to
  anyone through procedures identified in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).



Private sector:

	Confidential – It is the highest level in this classification scheme. This
  category is reserved for extremely sensitive data and internal data. A considerable
  amount of damage may occur for an organization given this confidential data is
  divulged. Proprietary data, among other types of data, falls into this category.


	Private – Data for internal use only whose significance is great and its
  disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization. All
  data and information which is being processed inside an organization is to be
  handled by employees only and should not fall into the hands of outsiders.


	Sensitive – A classification label applied to data which is treated as
  classified in comparison to the public data. Negative consequences may ensue
  if such kind of data is disclosed.


	Public – The lowest level of classification whose disclosure will not cause
  serious negative consequences to the organization.



NIST Special Publication 800-181 Revision 1 - Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity
(NICE Framework)


The NICE Framework is comprised of the following components:

	Categories (7) – A high-level grouping of common cybersecurity functions

	Specialty Areas (33) – Distinct areas of cybersecurity work

	Work Roles (52) – The most detailed groupings of cybersecurity work comprised
  of specific knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required to perform tasks
  in a Work Role



NIST NICE Framework: Securely Provision (SP) NICE Specialty Areas

	a. Risk Management (RSK)
	b. Software Development (DEV)
	c. Systems Architecture (ARC)
	d. Technology R&D (TRD)
	e. Systems Requirements Planning (SRP)
	f. Test & Evaluation (TST)
	g. Systems Development (SYS)


Risk Management (RSK) - Oversees, evaluates, and supports the documentation, validation,
assessment, and authorization processes necessary to assure that existing and
new information technology (IT) systems meet the organization's cybersecurity
and risk requirements. Ensures appropriate treatment of risk, compliance, and
assurance from internal and external perspectives.


Software Development (DEV) - Develops and writes/codes new (or modifies existing)
computer applications, software, or specialized utility programs following
software assurance best practices.


Systems Architecture (ARC) - Develops system concepts and works on the capabilities
phases of the systems development life cycle; translates technology and
environmental conditions (e.g., law and regulation) into system and security
designs and processes.


Technology R&D (TRD) - Conducts technology assessment and integration processes;
provides and supports a prototype capability and/or evaluates its utility.


Systems Requirements Planning (SRP) - Consults with customers to gather and
evaluate functional requirements and translates these requirements into technical
solutions. Provides guidance to customers about applicability of information
systems to meet business needs.


Test & Evaluation (TST) - Develops and conducts tests of systems to evaluate
compliance with specifications and requirements by applying principles and
methods for cost-effective planning, evaluating, verifying, and validating of
technical, functional, and performance characteristics (including
  interoperability) of systems or elements of systems incorporating IT.


Systems Development (SYS) - Works on the development phases of the systems
development life cycle.
