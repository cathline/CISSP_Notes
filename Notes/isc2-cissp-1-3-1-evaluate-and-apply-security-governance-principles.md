## Evaluate and apply security governance principles


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Evaluate and apply security governance principles such as security frameworks
through your daily practice as an information security professional.


### External Resources:

Evaluate and apply security governance principles

Information security management validates appropriate policies, procedures,
standards, and guidelines are implemented to ensure business operations are
conducted within an acceptable level of risk.


A Security Framework
- acts as a reference point
- provides a common language for communications (CULTURE OF SECURITY)
- allows us to share information and create relevancy

DEEP DIVE ON SABSA, TOGAF & ZACHMAN


SABSA -

A methodology for developing business-driven, risk and opportunity focused
Security Architectures at both enterprise and solutions level that traceably
support business objectives.

It is also widely used for Information Assurance Architectures, Risk Management
Frameworks, and to align and seamlessly integrate security and risk management
into IT Architecture methods and frameworks.

SABSA is comprised of a series of integrated frameworks, models, methods and
processes, used independently or as an holistic integrated enterprise solution,
including:

	Business Requirements Engineering Framework (known as Attributes Profiling)
	Risk and Opportunity Management Framework
	Policy Architecture Framework
	Security Services-Oriented Architecture Framework
	Governance Framework
	Security Domain Framework
	Through-life Security Service Management & Performance Management Framework

TOGAF Standard, Version 9.2


In particular, the following concepts are included:

	Partitioning – a number of techniques and considerations on how to partition
	the various architectures within an enterprise.

	Architecture Repository – a logical information model for an Architecture
	Repository which can be used as an integrated store for all outputs created by
	executing the Architecture Development Method (ADM).

	Capability Framework – a structured definition of the organization, skills,
	roles, and responsibilities required to operate an effective enterprise
	architecture capability. The TOGAF standard also provides guidance on a process
	that can be followed to identify and establish an appropriate architecture
	capability.


What Kinds of Architecture does the TOGAF Standard Deal with?

Business Architecture - The business strategy, governance, organization, and key
business processes.

Data Architecture - The structure of an organization’s logical and physical data
assets and data management resources.

Application Architecture - A blueprint for the individual applications to be
deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business
processes of the organization.

Technology Architecture - The logical software and hardware capabilities that
are required to support the deployment of business, data, and application
services. This includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications,
processing, and standards.


=========================================

The Zachman Framework -

The Framework for Enterprise Architecture (or Zachman Framework) as it applies
to Enterprises is simply a logical structure for classifying and organizing the
descriptive representations of an Enterprise that are significant to the
management of the Enterprise as well as to the development of the Enterprise’s
systems, manual systems as well as automated systems.
