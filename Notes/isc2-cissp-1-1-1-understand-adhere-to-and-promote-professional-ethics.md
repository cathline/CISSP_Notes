Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification. For our clientele, and the public at large, to see the value in (ISC)2 certifications, they must be able to trust our members; this trust must come from a belief that (ISC)2 members act in a manner that is correct and professional and offer benefit.”
