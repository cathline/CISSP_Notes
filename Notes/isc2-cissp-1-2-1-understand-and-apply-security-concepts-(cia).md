## Understand and apply security concepts (CIA)


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand and apply the security concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability through your daily practice as an information security professional.


### External Resources:

Understand and apply concepts of confidentiality, integrity and availability

1. Confidentiality - "Keeping good data away from bad actors"

For Confidentiality to be maintained in a network, data must be protected at
rest, in use and on the wire.

Violations of Confidentiality can come from ANYWHERE, at ANY TIME... bad
decisions on the part of users, administrators and customers can all lead to a
violation. Also, remember that security policies that are not implemented
properly can lead to potential confidentiality violations.

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. encryption
	b. traffic padding
	c. strict access controls / authentication
	d. data classification
	e. awareness training


Confidentiality & Integrity depend on each other. One is not effective without
the other.

Additional concepts linked to Confidentiality:

	1. sensitivity
	2. discretion
	3. criticality
	4. concealment
	5. isolation


2. Integrity - "Change control for data - no unauthorized modification without
knowledge and consent of data owner"

Three ways in which we can understand Integrity:

	1. Preventing unauthorized subjects from making modifications
	2. Preventing authorized subjects from making unauthorized modifications
	3. Maintaining consistency of objects so that they are true and accurate

Possible countermeasures include:

	a. strict access controls / authentication
	b. IDS
	c. encryption
	d. hashing
	e. interface restrictions / controls
	f. input / function checks (validation)


Additional concepts linked to Integrity:

	1. accuracy
	2. authenticity
	3. validity
	4. nonrepudiation - user cannot deny having performed an action


3. Availability - authorized subjects can access objects in a timely manner
without interruption


Possible countermeasures include:

	a. strict access controls / authentication
	b. continuous monitoring
	c. firewalls & routers to prevent DoS / DDoS attacks
	d. redundant system design
	e. periodic testing of backup systems


Additional concepts linked to Availability:

	1. usability
	2. accessibility
	3. timeliness
