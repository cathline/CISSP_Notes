## Understand and apply risk management concepts


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand and apply risk management concepts through your daily practice as an
information security professional.


### External Resources:

Understand and apply risk management concepts

MUST KNOW CONCEPTS !!: NIST SP800-30R1 page 12

Risk: The probability (likelihood) that a given threat source will exercise a
particular vulnerability and the resulting impact should that occur

Threat -  an event or situation that if it occurred, would prevent the
organization from operating in its normal manner

Vulnerability - weakness

Likelihood - chance something might happen

Impact - what a threat will cost (quantitative/qualitative)

Countermeasure (control) - mechanism applied to minimize risk

Residual Risk - remaining risk(s) after all countermeasures/controls have been
applied

1. Identify threats and vulnerabilities - NIST SP800-30R1
	A vulnerability is “an inherent weakness in an information system, security
  procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by
  a threat source"


2. Risk assessment/analysis - NIST SP800-30R1 page 23
	Step 1 - Prepare for Assessment
	Step 2 - Conduct Assessment
		a. Identify threat sources & events
		b. Identify vulnerabilities & predisposing conditions
		c. Determine likelihood of occurrence
		d. Determine magnitude of impact
		e. Determine Risk
	Step 3 - Communicate Results
	Step 4 - Maintain Assessment

3. Risk response - treatment/treat
	1. Avoid
	2. Accept
	3. Transfer
	4. Mitigate

4. Countermeasure selection and implementation
	Cost
	Effectiveness
	Appropriateness

5. Applicable types of controls (e.g., preventive, detective, corrective)

Control Categories
	• Physical
	• Administrative
	• Logical (Technical)


The seven main types of control are:

	1. Directive: attempt to specify action(s) to ensure compliance with security
  policy

	2. Deterrent: attempt to discourage security policy violations. Key difference
  between Preventative and Deterrent is that preventative blocks action while
  deterrent relies on individual making the right choice

	3. Preventive: attempt to stop unwanted access

	4. Compensating: attempt to provide an alternate control in absence of primary

	5. Detective: attempt to identify unauthorized access AFTER occurrence of
  unauthorized activity

	6. Corrective: modifies environment to return to normal operation AFTER
  occurrence of unauthorized activity

	7. Recovery: attempt to repair or restore after a security violation - extension
  of corrective controls, but have more advanced capabilities



6. Security Control Assessment (SCA) - Monitor your controls to assess how well
they are performing

	Tailoring - filtering

	Scoping - what is in & what is out

	Supplementation - making additions (adding on) to add value and support for
  mission objectives

	Types of assessments:

	a. Vulnerability
		Scanning
		Analysis
		Communicate results

	b. Penetration

	Strategies:
		• External testing
		• Internal testing
		• Blind testing
		• Double-blind testing

	Categories:
		• Zero knowledge    - Black Box
		• Partial knowledge - Grey Box
		• Full knowledge    - White Box

	Methodology:
		1. Reconnaissance
		2. Enumeration
		3. Vulnerability analysis
		4. Execution / Exploitation
		5. Document findings

	c. Application
	d. DoS / DDoS
	e. WAR...
	f. Wireless
	g. Social Engineering
	h. Telephony

7. Monitoring and measurement - The 2 Q's

	Quantitative - measures "tangibles" | Numerical assessment

	Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) = Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) * Annual Rate Occurrence (ARO)

	       SLE * ARO = ALE
	$ 1,000.00 * 3 = $3,000


	Qualitative - measures "intangibles" | the product of likelihood and impact
  produces the level of risk. The higher the risk level, the more immediate the
  need for the organization to address the issue. (Risk Matrix)

	Process steps:
		• Approval  - Senior Management gives us this
		• Form a Risk Assessment Team
		• Analyze Data
		• Calculate Risk
		• Countermeasure Recommendations

8. Asset valuation - understanding tangible / intangible worth

9. Reporting - Gotta have it !!! (timeliness and understandability)

10. Continuous improvement - Deming Cycle (PDCA)

11. Risk frameworks -

COSO -  identifies 5 areas necessary to meet the financial reporting and
disclosure objectives. These include:
	a. Control environment
	b. Risk assessment
	c. Control activities
	d. Information and communication
	e. Monitoring


ITIL -  showing how controls can be implemented for the service management IT
processes. 5 Lifecycle phases:
	1. Service Strategy
	2. Service Design
	3. Service Transition
	4. Service Operation
	5. Continual Service Improvement (CSI)

COBIT -  examines the effectiveness, efficiency, confidentiality, integrity,
availability, compliance, and reliability aspects of the high-level control
objectives.
