## Legal & regulatory issues for information security


### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

Understand and apply the recommended guidance pertinent to how to identify
legal & regulatory issues for information security in areas such as Intellectual
Property and export controls through your daily practice as an information
security professional.


### External Resources:

Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in
a holistic context


  1. Cyber crimes and data breaches

When assessing the effect of cybercrime, you need to evaluate areas such as:

 a. Loss of intellectual property and / or sensitive data
 b. Damage to brand image/reputation
 c. Penalties and compensatory payments
 d. Cost of countermeasures

 Event - something that has happened

 Incident - some sort of occurrence or event that has a negative outcome (ITIL)

 Breach - an occurrence or event that has a negative outcome

 Disclosure - making "secret" information public


  2. Licensing and intellectual property requirements

 Patent - A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state or
 intergovernmental organization to an inventor or assignee for a limited period
 of time (typically 20 years) in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an
 invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem and
 is a product or a process.

 Copyright - protects published or unpublished original work from unauthorized
 duplication without due credit and compensation. Copyright covers not only books
 but also advertisements, articles, graphic designs, labels, letters
 (including emails), lyrics, maps, musical compositions, product designs, etc.


Works Created on or after January 1, 1978 -

The law automatically protects a work that is created and fixed in a tangible
medium of expression on or after January 1, 1978, from the moment of its creation
and gives it a term lasting for the author’s life plus an additional 70 years.
For a “joint work prepared by two or more authors who did not work for hire,” the
term lasts for 70 years after the last surviving author’s death.

For works made for hire and anonymous and pseudonymous works, the duration of
copyright is 95 years from first publication or 120 years from creation, whichever
is shorter (unless the author’s identity is later revealed in Copyright Office
records, in which case the term becomes the author’s life plus 70 years).


According to the major international intellectual-property protection treaties
(Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention, and WIPO Copyright Treaty)
five rights are associated with a copyright, the right to:

(1) Reproduce the work in any form, language, or medium
(2) Adapt or derive more works from it
(3) Make and distribute its copies
(4) Perform it in public
(5) Display or exhibit it in public

 Trademark - a recognizable sign, design, or unique expression related to
 products or services of a particular source from those of others, usually
 called service marks.


  3. Import/export controls

 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) - What is considered exportable

 Export Administration Regulations (EAR) - Under what conditions can we export

 The Wassenaar Arrangement - Dual-Use Goods


  4. Trans-border data flows

OECD Declaration on Transborder Data Flows, OECD Digital Economy Paper
No. 1 (Apr. 11, 1985)

"Rapid technological developments in the field of information, computers and
communications are leading to significant structural changes in the economies of
Member countries. Flows of computerized data and information are an important
consequence of technological advances and are playing an increasing role in
national economies. With the growing economic interdependence of Member
countries, these flows acquire an international dimension, known as transborder
data flows."

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines

  3. Purpose Specification
  4. Use Limitation
  5. Security Safeguards
